# Learn Command

Suggest two similar areas where improvements could be made and highlight what the issues are. After addressing the issues, explain what could be done differently to improve the overall codebase.

After your exposition, pose a question to make the user find similar defects in the code and make them try to explain what could be done differently.

Focus on: $ARGUMENTS

## Process:
1. **Identify** two similar problematic patterns/areas
2. **Highlight** specific issues in each area
3. **Address** how to fix these issues
4. **Explain** broader improvement strategies
5. **Challenge** the user to find and solve similar problems independently

Make the learning interactive - guide discovery, don't just provide answers.
